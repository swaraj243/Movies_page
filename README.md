# Movies Download Page - Maven WebApp

Welcome to the **Movies Download Page** repository! This project is a web application built using **Maven**, designed to allow users to browse and download movies.

## Features

- **Browse Movies**: View a list of available movies.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for movies by title, genre, or year.
- **Download Movies**: Download movies directly to your device.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you’ll need:

- **Java 8 or higher**
- **Maven 3.x**
- A servlet container (e.g., **Apache Tomcat**)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movies-download-page.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd movies-download-page
    ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. Deploy the webapp to your servlet container (e.g., **Tomcat**). If you're using Tomcat, copy the `target/movies-download-page.war` file to the `webapps/` folder of your Tomcat installation.

5. Start your servlet container and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/movies-download-page`.

### Running the Webapp Locally

You can also run the webapp locally using the Maven plugin:

    ```bash
    mvn jetty:run
    ```

This will start a local server, and you can access the app at `http://localhost:8080`.
